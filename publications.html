				<!--<a onMouseover="fixedtooltip('<p> This paper studies the consensus tracking control for multi-agent systems (MASs) of general linear dynamics con- sidering heterogeneous constant known input and communication delays under a directed communication graph containing a spanning tree. First, for open-loop stable MASs, a distributed predictive observer is proposed to estimate the consensus tracking error and to construct the control input that does not involve any integral term (which is time-efficient in calculation). Then, using the generalized Nyquist criterion, we derive the conditions for asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system and show that is delay-independent. Subsequently, another observer is designed that allows the MASs to be open-loop unstable. Next, we use the generalized Nyquist criterion to compute the observer’s gain matrix. Towards this end, we choose a specific structure with which the problem boils down to computing a single parameter, herein called the predictive observer parameter. Two algorithms are proposed for choosing this parameter: one for general linear systems and one for monotone systems.

			<!--<a onMouseover="fixedtooltip('<p> Full-duplex (FD) systems are able to transmit and receive signals over the same frequency band simultaneously with the potential of even doubling the spectral efficiency in comparison with the traditional half-duplex (HD) systems. When combined with relaying, FD systems are expected to dramatically increase the throughput of future wireless networks. However, the degrading effect of self-interference (SI) due to the simultaneous transmission and reception at the relay threatens their efficient roll-out in real-world topologies. At the same time, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can further increase the spectral efficiency of the network. In this article, we present how buffering at the relays can be integrated with FD and NOMA in order to improve the performance of relay networks. More specifically, the key points for the successful integration of buffer-aided relays with spatial sharing paradigms are presented and details on buffer state information-based relay selection and its fully distributed implementation are discussed. Furthermore, a mathematical framework for the analysis of FD and HD buffer-aided relay networks is rigorously discussed. Performance evaluation shows the importance of data buffering towards mitigating SI and improving the sum-rate of the network.

			<!--<a onMouseover="fixedtooltip('<p>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) aims to increase the spectral efficiency of fifth generation (5G) networks by relaxing the orthogonal use of radio-resources. In this work, a network with multiple half-duplex (HD) buffer-aided (BA) relays is considered, where the source transmits with fixed rate towards two users. The users might demand the same rate by the source (e.g., two cellular users requiring the same service), or they could have different rate requirements (e.g., a cellular user coexisting with an Internet of Things (IoT) device). By deploying multiple BA relays, increased reliability and additional degrees of freedom are provided. Leveraging the spectral efficiency of NOMA and the increased diversity gain of BA relaying, two relay selection algorithms with broadcasting are proposed for power-domain (PD) NOMA and hybrid NOMA/OMA, namely BA–NOMA and BA–NOMA/OMA, respectively. BA–NOMA can improve the performance in terms of outage probability when the power allocation factor α is selected such that robustness against channel uncertainties due to, e.g., outdated channel state information (CSI), is provided. Moreover, BA–NOMA/OMA further improves the sum-rate by switching to OMA when the relays cannot serve the users through NOMA. Moreover, both algorithms reduce the average delay by avoiding the delay of orthogonal scheduling and prioritizing the relay-destination transmission.

Such a setup could represent a cellular downlink scenario, in which the source can be a more powerful wireless device with a buffer and multiple antennas, while a set of intermediate less powerful devices are used as relays to reach the destination. The main target is to recover the multiplexing loss of the network by having the source and a relay to simultaneously transmit their information to another relay and the destination, respectively. Successive transmissions in such a cooperative network, however, cause inter-relay interference (IRI). First, by assuming global channel state information (CSI), we show that the detrimental effect of IRI can be alleviated by precoding at the source, mitigating or even fully cancelling the interference. A cooperative relaying policy is proposed that employs a joint precoding design and relay-pair selection. Note that both fixed rate and adaptive rate transmissions can be considered. For the case when channel state information is only available at the receiver side (CSIR), we propose a relay selection policy that employs a phase alignment technique to reduce the IRI. The performance of the two proposed relay pair selection policies are evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art relaying schemes  in terms of outage and throughput.

More specifically, we first propose two new delay-aware policies. One is based on the Hybrid Relay Selection (HRS) algorithm, where the relay selection takes into account the queue sizes so that delay is reduced and diversity is maintained. The other approach is based on the max-link relay selection algorithm. For the max-link algorithm, a delay-aware only approach starves the buffers and increases the outage probability of the system. Thus, for max-link, we propose a delay- and diversity-aware BA relay selection policy targeting the reduction of the average delay, while maintaining the diversity of the transmission. The proposed policies are analyzed by means of Markov Chains and expressions for the outage, throughput and delay are derived. The asymptotic performance of the policies is also discussed.

So, we propose a Low-Complexity (LoCo) link selection algorithm, herein called Loco-Link.

To alleviate this issue, we next propose a distributed version of Loco-Link (d-Loco-Link) dealing with outdated CSI. In both algorithms, the source performs broadcasting towards multiple relays; when the packets are transmitted by a relay to the destination, they are discarded from all other relays. This coordination relies on feedback channels. For non error-free feedback channels, we propose a scheme in which the relays listen to the transmission of the best relay and drop duplicate packets. Results show that $\locolink$ surpasses other algorithms, by decreasing the delay in asymmetric networks.

Within this framework of constrained optimal boundary flow gating, two main Quality of Service (QoS) metrics are considered: (a) first, connected to the NFD, the concept of average network travel time and delay as a QoS metric is defined; (b) second, at boundaries, we take into account additional external network queue dynamics governed by uncontrolled inflow demands. External queue capacities in terms of finite-link lengths are used as the second QoS metric. Hence, the corresponding QoS requirement is an upper bound of external queues. While external queues represent vehicles waiting to enter the protected network, internal queue describes the protected network aggregated behaviour.</p>  <p>By controlling the number of vehicles joining the internal queue from the external ones, herewith a network traffic flow maximization solution subject to the internal and external dynamics and their QoS constraints is developed. The originally non-convex optimization problem is transformed to a numerically efficiently convex one by relaxing the QoS constraints into time-dependent state boundaries. The control solution can be interpreted as a mechanism which transforms the unknown arrival process governing the number of vehicles entering the network to a regulated process, such that prescribed QoS requirements on travel time in the network and upper bound on the external queue are satisfied. Comparative numerical simulation studies on a microscopic traffic simulator are carried out to show the benefits of the proposed method.</p>  ', this, event, '710px')" onMouseout="delayhidetip()">Abstract</a> | <a target="_blank"  href="papers/j26_TRC.pdf">Full text</a> | <A HREF="bibtex/bibtex_j26_PartC.html"

Towards this end, we consider a scenario with intermittent energy arrivals described by a two-state Gilbert-Elliott Markov chain model. The challenge is that the state of the Markov chain can only be observed during the harvesting action, and not while in sleep mode. Two scenarios are studied under this model. In the first scenario, we assume that the transition probabilities of the Markov chain are known and formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We prove that the optimal policy has a threshold structure and derive the optimal decision parameters. In the practical scenario where the ratio between the reward and the penalty is neither too large nor too small, the POMDP framework and the threshold-based optimal policies are very useful for finding non-trivial optimal sleeping times. In the second scenario, we assume that the Markov chain parameters are unknown and formulate the problem as a Bayesian adaptive POMDP, and propose a heuristic posterior sampling algorithm to reduce the computational complexity.

When an action is carried out, which factors does your nervous system consider to determine the appropriate set of muscle forces between redundant degrees-of-freedom? Important factors determining motor output likely encompass effort and the resulting motor noise. However, the tasks used in many previous motor control studies could not identify these two factors uniquely, as signal-dependent noise monotonically increases as a function of the effort. To address this, a recent paper introduced a force control paradigm involving one finger in each hand that can disambiguate these two factors. It showed that the central nervous system considers both force noise and amplitude, with a larger weight on the absolute force and lower weights on both noise and normalized force. While these results are valid for the relatively low force range considered in that paper, the magnitude of the force shared between the fingers for large forces is not known. This paper investigates this question experimentally, and develops an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo method in order to estimate the weightings given to these factors. Our results demonstrate that the force sharing strongly depends on the force level required, so that for higher force levels the normalized force is considered as much as the absolute force, whereas the role of noise minimization becomes negligible.

Furthermore, we impose an interference cancellation (IC) threshold allowing the relay that is selected for reception, to decode and subtract the IRI.  The proposed relaying scheme selects the relaying pair that maximizes the average capacity of the relay network. Its performance is evaluated through simulations and comparisons with other state-of-the-art half- and full-duplex relay selection schemes, in terms of outage probability, average capacity and average delay. The results reveal that a tradeoff has to be made between improving the outage at the cost of reduced capacity and increased delay and vice versa. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future directions are discussed, including the need for a hybrid scheme incorporating both half- and full-duplex characteristics.

Resource management is an important and challenging task, especially for multi-tier applications with unpredictable time-varying workloads.  Work in resource management using control theory has shown clear benefits of dynamically adjusting resource allocations to match fluctuating workloads. However, little work has been done towards adaptive controllers for unknown workload types. This work presents a new resource management scheme that incorporates the Kalman filter into feedback controllers to dynamically allocate CPU resources to virtual machines hosting server applications. We present a set of controllers that continuously detect and self-adapt to unforeseen workload changes. Furthermore, our most advanced controller also self-configures itself without any a priori information and with a small 4.8% performance penalty in the case of high intensity workload changes. In addition, our controllers are enhanced to deal with multi-tier server applications: by using the pair-wise resource coupling between tiers, they improve server response to large workload increases as compared to controllers with no such resource-coupling mechanism. Our approaches are evaluated and their performance is illustrated on a 3-tier Rubis benchmark web-site deployed on a prototype Xen-virtualized cluster.

We show that many power control laws from the literature are contractive and derive, sometimes for the first time, analytical convergence rate estimates for these algorithms. We also prove that contractive interference functions converge when executed totally asynchronously and, under the assumption that the communication delay is bounded, derive an explicit bound on the convergence time penalty due to increased delay.

The role of an agent interacting during a motor task can be directly explained from the cost function this agent is minimizing and the task constraints.

To obtain guarantees of global optimality, we employ and extend techniques from polynomial optimization literature and provide a solution with a global convergence guarantee.

Two algorithms are proposed for choosing this parameter: one for general linear systems and one for monotone systems.

Autonomous vehicles are nowadays equipped with a multitude of sensors, the three primary being radar, lidar and camera. The combination of such sensors allows a vehicle, among others, to detect the distance and speed of nearby objects. In this paper, we incorporate the available sensors of vehicles to anticipate the communication delays vehicles experience with their preceding vehicles, thus improving the stability conditions and subsequently reducing the time headway. More specifically, by incorporating sensors we alleviate the commu- nication delays between neighboring vehicles. We demonstrate that (i) the system is internally stable irrespective of the size of the communication delays, and (ii) the time headway can be reduced, by deriving a sufficient condition which provides a lower bound on the time headway that guarantees string stability.

In addition, a distributed implementation of BB−0RS is presented, herein called d−BB−0RS, where distributed timers are used at the relays for relay selection, thus reducing the signaling overhead significantly.

The remote estimator provides error-free acknowledgement/negative-acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) messages to the sensor only when low power is utilized. We first consider the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem for the case of known GE channels and derive conditions for optimality of a stationary schedule.

To overcome the nonconvexity of the outage probability constraints under Rician fading, we use the concept of coherent-measure-of-risk from the field of finance. We therefore obtain a linear programming formulation that we can efficiently solve. Simulations show that HyD2D selects the most energy-efficient relaying operation that satisfies the  success probability requirement, while leveraging only statistical channel state information. </p> ', this, event, '710px')" onMouseout="delayhidetip()">Abstract</a> | Full text | Bibtex | Presentation -->

While external queues represent vehicles waiting to enter the protected network, an internal queue can be used to describe the network's aggregated behaviour. By controlling the number of vehicles entering the internal queue, the travel time within the network subject to the vehicular conservation law and the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) can be subsequently controlled. The admission controller can thus be interpreted as a mechanism which transforms the unknown arrival process governing the number of vehicles entering the network to a regulated process, such that prescribed QoS requirements on travel time in the network and upper bound on the external queue are satisfied.

Resource management of virtualized servers is an important and challenging task, especially when dealing with fluctuating workloads and complex multi-tier server applications.

This paper presents a new resource management scheme that integrates the Kalman filter into feedback controllers to dynamically allocate CPU resources to virtual machines hosting server applications. The novelty of our approach is the use of the Kalman filter-the optimal filtering technique for state estimation in the sum of squares sense-to track the CPU utilizations and update the allocations accordingly. Our basic controllers continuously detect and self-adapt to unforeseen workload intensity changes. Our more advanced controller self-configures itself to any workload condition without any a priori information. Indicatively, it results in within 4.8% of the performance of workload-aware controllers under high intensity workload changes, and performs equally well under medium intensity traffic. In addition, our controllers are enhanced to deal with multi-tier server applications: by using the pair-wise resource coupling between application components, they provide a 3% on average server performance improvement when facing large unexpected workload increases when compared to controllers with no such resource-coupling mechanism.

This is due to the need to properly coordinate the information exchange between sensors, actuators, and  controllers   in order to enforce a desirable behavior without relying on a centralized decision maker. In this monograph, we present some recent progress in this area by focusing on the key operations of distributed average consensus and weight/flow balancing under a variety of communication topologies and adversarial network conditions, e.g.,   delays, and packet drops.

The goal is to assign time slots (or channels) and transmitting powers to communication links such that all communication requests are processed correctly, specified Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements are met, and the number of required time slots is minimized. The first main result proves that the problem, also known as the wireless scheduling problem, is NP-hard. We then solve a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the problem with Branch \& Bound (B\&B) and Cutting Plane (CP) approaches. We enhance the computational performance of these schemes with heuristic procedures that provide tighter upper and lower bounds. We close with an extensive computational study, which shows that despite the complexity of the problem, the proposed methodology scales to problems of nontrivial size. Our algorithms can therefore serve as a benchmark for the performance evaluation of heuristic or distributed algorithms that aim to find near-optimal solutions without information about the whole network.', this, event, '710px')" onMouseout="delayhidetip()">Abstract</a> | <a target="_blank"  href="papers/TR649.pdf">Full text</a> | <A HREF="bibtex/bibtex_networks_TR2.html"

The Foschini-Miljanic (FM) algorithm is provably stable if there are no time-delays in the execution of the algorithm or when these delays are constant. This work presents a more realistic version of the well known Foschini-Miljanic algorithm for Distributed Power Control since it considers the robustness of the algorithm in the presence of time-varying delays. Using the classical Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional we prove that the FM algorithm is Globally Asymptotically Stable (GAS) for arbitrarily large time-varying delays, given the delay derivative is less than one.

Our in- vestigation brings forward some problems on the design of distributed power control algorithms, therefore a part of the thesis is devoted to the design and performance evaluation of distributed power control algorithms in wireless ad hoc networks while trying to tackle these problems. We first define and study capacity and Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise (SINR) regions for wire- less ad hoc networks with an arbitrary number of nodes and topology. These regions describe the set of achievable rate combinations between all source-destination pairs in the network under various transmission strategies, such as variable-rate transmission, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and power control. Next, making use of a variety of control theoretic tools such as the Nyquist Multivariate crite- rion and Lyapunov theory, stability and robustness to uncertainties of an existing power control algorithm are studied rigorously. For this algorithm, theoretical results obtained are supported and demonstrated via high-level MATLAB simulations. This algorithm operates in a single channel and aims to maintain a pre-defined SINR. It converges to the global optimum if there exists a feasible solution to the network, but diverges if there is not. Furthermore, we study how the distributed algorithm should be modified in order to prevent the system from diverging in cases there does not exist a feasible solution and establish some tolerable performance levels. Towards this end, a contention-based approach is proposed that uses power control to access the network. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through MATLAB simulations. We know that, in reality, there exist more than one channels available. Therefore, we further try to find how all the available channels can be utilized, such that a minimum performance level is guar- antied on average while adapting to the varying channels’ conditions. In this work, a distributed algorithm is developed that converges to a feasible solution if one exists by using all the available channels and by allowing the transmitters to use varying transfer rates. Finally, we address the problem of finding the minimum number of time-slots (or channels) re- quired in any given network and the corresponding transmitting powers, such that all communi- cation requests are being processed correctly, while fulfilling specific constraints for successful transmissions that conform with the channel Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.', this, event, '710px')" onMouseout="delayhidetip()">Abstract</a> | <A HREF="bibtex/bibtex_2010thesis.html"
